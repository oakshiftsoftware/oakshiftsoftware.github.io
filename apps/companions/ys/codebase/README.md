# Young Suns Companion Application (Unofficial)
The files attached in this directory ('main.py', 'services.py' and 'requirements.txt') are the only files required to be able to replicate the end result APK of the application.
All three files should exist within the same directory, and the required Python libraries should be installed prior to running the 'main.py' file.
As mentioned in the application itself, Young Suns is a game that is created and owned by KO_OP (www.ko-opmode.com), and as such they also deserve credit for the game itself as well as the referenced game conted within the companion application. Oakshift Software is ONLY responsible for assembling the Python code behind the APK (and the APK itself).
